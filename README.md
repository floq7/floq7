- 💻 NLP engineer at Memect 
- 📚 UMD CS Alum 
- 📰 Sports journalist

When I was sixteen years old, I started reading Yu Kwang-Chung's poetry and literary critiques. Yu, who studied English literature, was globally recognized for his grasp of both traditional and modern Chinese literature. As a character-based hieroglyph, Chinese Intellectuals explored and experimented for a century to infuse Chinese and West Language to adapt to the more and more flatted world. After graduating from high school, I went to Macao, a melting pot of Portugal and Chinese culture. Residents and visitors there speak different dialects of Chinese, English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, etc. As a kid who never left my hometown for a long period, this experience made me realize the colorfulness of the languages. Then, I was fortunate enough to be admitted to the University of Maryland and jump into the Computer Science major with limited coding experience. Given the heavy workload, I stayed in the fight and finished the fight. Eventually, I nail my degree during the pandemic. Now, I am an Enthusiastic NLP engineer, dedicated to understanding the ambiguity and richness of natural languages by computers.
